## What is this project?
Tessel is a completely open source and community-driven IoT and robotics development platform. It encompases development boards, hardware module add-ons, and the software that runs on them.

One common misconception is that we're a company. We're not! We're just a collection of (unpaid) people who find it worthwhile to spend our time building towards the Tessel Project [mission](MISSION.md).

### What's a Tessel?
Our website [tessel.io](https://tessel.io) should give you an overview of the hardware we build. You can see examples of things people have built on Tessel on our [projects page](https://tessel.io/projects).

### What is this Tessel Project all about?
Tessel is about designing intuitive and accessible hardware development experiences around the open web. Feel free to read more about our [mission](MISSION.md) and [governance model](GOVERNANCE.md). Please also read and adhere to our [code of conduct](https://github.com/tessel/project/blob/master/CONDUCT.md).

### What can I find in this repo?
This repository is for the organization and governance of the Tessel project as a whole. For code, see the [Tessel GitHub organization](https://github.com/tessel).

For an introduction to the project's organization and key repos, check out the [Technical Overview](https://tessel.gitbooks.io/t2-docs/content/Debugging/Technical_Overview.html).

# Current goals

On September 2, 2016, the Steering Committee set year-long goals. They are organized into two overarching goals, each with several supporting goals:

1. **Grow the community for development, inclusion, accessibility**
  * [ ] Build effective working groups that can complete their tasks with measurable results. Celebrate the work of each of the working groups as goals are accomplished
  * [ ] Upgrade our documentation. Build more fritzing examples, API prototypes, and call out features that are currently missing from the docs
  * [ ] Update the tessel.io website to more accurately represent the project and its plans (https://github.com/tessel/tessel.io/issues/102)
2. **Demonstrate projects and create new tools that prove Tessel is a production-ready (robust, reliable, and extensible) platform for modern hardware development**
  * [ ] Create a guide to production-scale deployment of a Tessel project
  * [ ] Research user needs: What do people need to use T2 in production? Why aren't they using it currently?
  * [ ] Build Reach (https://github.com/tessel/project/issues/142)
  * [ ] Get to JavaScript parity with Rust API and documentation (https://github.com/tessel/tessel-rust). Figure out JS-Rust inter-exection
  * [ ] Investigate and possibly execute a Tessel hardware upgrade (Tessel 2.1) for more RAM and Flash. This should legitimize the platform and build out the capabilities so there is less user experience friction

## Working groups

To enable the above goals, the Tessel Project is establishing working groups.

### What's a working group?
* A working group (WG) is a group of people working toward a defined, accomplishable goal.
* WGs create some output measure of progress on a regular (every 1-2 weeks) schedule, whether that's meeting notes or something else

### What working groups do we need to accomplish this year's goals?
* **Website WG**:  Create a better website for what we are & what we plan to be based on this year’s goals
* **Rust WG**: Get Rust to 1st class support
* **Reach WG**: ship Reach
* **Learning WG**: investigate user needs for production & write a guide on how to take a Tessel project to product scale. Also build and document GPIO/GUTS (Great Uses for Tessel in Stuff e.g. hacking a production system) projects
* **Tessel space WG**: make larger projects deployable on T2, possibly as a 2.1 Tessel hardware

### How do we implement these WGs?
We don't want to kick off all 5 at once, so we've picked 2 as pilots: website WG and Learning WG. These two are selected because they are reasonably well defined, accessible, and don't require specialized skills.

We will bring up the other WGs as we become comfortable with the process.

# How can I get involved?

## Quick start

1. [Join the team slack](//tessel-slack.herokuapp.com) and express your interest in contributing in the #community channel. You will receive a warm welcome.
2. Read the [Technical Overview](https://tessel.gitbooks.io/t2-docs/content/Debugging/Technical_Overview.html) to see if any particular area of the project strikes your fancy.
3. Back on Slack, let us know if there's something in particular you'd like to work on – we're happy to help you get set up! A general post in #community should work.
