## Last week's items

- @tcr SendInBlue is the best alternative to MailChimp moving forward, hopefully full switch in the next 2 weeks. :email:

## This week's items

@johnnyman727 to @tcr, can you update your [Window's fix gist](https://gist.github.com/tcr/992978a5dbe5bff2e18f495c5c0973c3)? 

### Repo Maintenance 

@frijol what repos are still relevant? Can we remove some of the Tessel 1 repos? Or uncompleted projects? When making global changes to our org, like adding a CoC badge to README, there are a lot of projects that have not been touched in a while.

@tcr what does it mean to have an unmaintained repo? How do we make that apparent at a glance?

@hipsterbrown How can a community member claim a repo to maintain?

@tcr We should have standard copy for unmaintained repos and how to claim them. We can try it out on tessel/cc3000-async.

### Money & TesselCamp

@frijol Did we ever get money from Seeed for sold Tessels and modules?

@hipsterbrown Got an estimate from TesselCamp co-working, $350/day including food and coffee.

@rwaldron Bocoup might have some budget in the Web-Connected Devices department for sponsoring
