## Notes

* #16, #20, #24: see action items

### Steering Committee membership

* Tim: people take the membership roles at face value. More conservative re whose input is terribly valuable for the governance structureâ€“ keep as small as possible b/c the tradeoff in agility could be a problem. Try to get people who cover the most qualities, not just uniaxial ability.
* Kelsey: generally makes sense to filter through the Collaborator role rather than directly pulling people into the SC

### Collaborators

* Let's get excited people first to build up the community/excitement
* Broad acceptance
* Generally avoid mean people
