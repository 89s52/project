## Getting started as a team member
The [Steering Committee](https://github.com/tessel/project/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md) invites contributors to become Team Members, typically after they have made some substantial contribution to the project.

* **Your first PR.** Officially add yourself as a Team Member. You can do so by opening up a Pull Request on the [tessel/project repo's  Team page](https://github.com/tessel/project/blob/master/TEAM.md). Check out [this PR as an example](https://github.com/tessel/project/pull/63).

* **Get started with your Tessel 2.** Go to the [Tessel 2 start page](http://tessel.github.io/t2-start/) and try it out! This should get you set up with using the CLI, connecting to Wifi, and using modules.

* **Get to know T2's tech stack and repos.** You'll be much more equipped to make meaningful contributions if you read the [Tessel 2 Technical Overview](https://tessel.gitbooks.io/t2-docs/content/debugging/Technical_Overview.html). This guide goes over the main repositories, where you can find relevant code and design files, and how the Tessel 2 system architecture works.

* **Get to know your mentor.** Once you're part of the team and you have a high-level understanding of how Tessel 2 works, get in touch with the person that introduced you to the project and set up a time to chat. This informal call will help you understand the current state of the project, where your help is needed most, and how you can get started. If you're not sure who to contact, get in touch with the person who accepted [your first PR](#2-get-started-with-your-tessel-2) or [jump on Slack and let us know you're ready to get started](https://tessel-slack.herokuapp.com/).

* **Get to know the team.** Our primary communication channel is [Slack](https://tessel-slack.herokuapp.com/). We recommend keeping it open while you're working on Tessel; it's very useful for asking quick questions. Important channels:

  * #engineering for most of your technical questions
  * #team-members for discussion with your fellow Team Members
  * #events-speaking if you're interested in giving conference talks

* **Do something!** Your mentor can help you find something to work on, or the [T2 Completeness Checklist](https://github.com/tessel/project/issues/70) is a good place to start. Pick something, ask questions, and get started!

## Approving or rejecting modifications to assets (such as bug fixes, code refactoring, or minor API or feature changes)

1. A change request is received (PR, RFC, etc.).
1. Within a week, a TM should be assigned to respond either automatically or manually by another TM.
1. If TMs cannot come to an agreement on approval or rejection, an involved TM should make an issue [here](https://github.com/technicalmachine/tessel-project/issues) tagged ‘sc-agenda’ for discussion by the SC.

Guidelines:

1. If you're not sure about something, pull in someone else to help review. Check the repo's contributor graph (repo url/graphs/contributors) to find someone familiar with the repository.
1. Two (or more) Collaborators should agree to approve or reject anything major.
1. Allow an adequate amount of time (two days is suitable) for discussion before merging/closing.

## Managing feature requests and RFCs

1. Discussion of major new features should take place on the [RFC repo](https://github.com/tessel/rfcs) for each particular addition. These can be proposed by anyone.

## Maintaining strong communication with the community

### Support

1. A support request is received on the forums.
1. Within a week, if no one from the community has resolved the question, a TM should respond.

### Blog Posts

TMs are encouraged to post new features or interesting facets of the project to the blog. Please make a PR to [this repo](https://github.com/tessel/this-week-in-tessel) with your post!

## Ensuring open and respectful discourse

If a member of the community is unkind or disrespectful, TMs should encourage more constructive discourse by responding politely, kindly, and respectfully. Do not engage in a flame war.

TMs should review the [Code of Conduct](CONDUCT.md) and ensure that it is followed. Harassment/abuse/etc. should be brought to the attention of the SC as outlined in the Code of Conduct. The SC will take appropriate action to ban abusive members.
