## Approving or rejecting modifications to assets (such as bug fixes, code refactoring, or minor API or feature changes)

Something is received (PR, RFC, etc.)
Within a week, a collaborator should be assigned to respond either automatically or manually by another collaborator.
Two (or more) Collaborators must agree to approve or reject the proposed change
Any modifications to assets should be open for a minimum of 24 hours to allow discussion
If Collaborators cannot come to an agreement on approval or rejection, an involved Collaborator should make an issue [here](https://github.com/technicalmachine/tessel-project/issues) tagged ‘sc-agenda’ for discussion by the SC.

## Managing feature requests and RFCs

Discussion of major new features should take place on the [forums](https://forums.tessel.io/c/contributing/rfc). These can be proposed by anyone.
When a consensus of two or more Collaborators is reached, a Collaborator will sum up the RFC into a comprehensive spec on the forum. 
The Collaborator will then open up all relevant Issues on any appropriate Github repos outlining implementation details. On each Github issue, a link back to the original RFC Forum thread should be placed. 
On the original RFC Forum thread, the Collaborator will create a checklist of all of the Github issues they created.

## Maintaining strong communication with the community

### Support

A support request is received on the forums
Within a week, if no one from the community has resolved the question, a Collaborator should respond.

### Blog Posts

Collaborators are encouraged to post new features or interesting facets of the project to the blog. Credentials to the technical.io blog (Tumblr) will be shared with Collaborators and they should feel free to post any time. Kelsey ([@selkeymoonbeam](//twitter.com/selkeymoonbeam)) is happy to review and offer suggestions on any posts prior to publishing.

## Ensuring open and respectful discourse

If a member of the community is unkind or disrespectful, Collaborators should encourage more constructive discourse by responding politely, kindly, and respectfully. Do not engage in a flame war.

Collaborators should review the [Code of Conduct](LINK) and ensure that it is followed. Harassment/abuse/etc. should be brought to the attention of the SC as outlined in the Code of Conduct. The SC will take appropriate action to ban abusive members.
