# Finances

The Tessel Project (as of May 2016) has its funds held by the non-profit Dojo Foundation.

Funds for the Tessel Project are generated in a few ways:

1. We receive royalties from our manufacturing partners, usually a few percentage points of each product sold.
2. We generated money through Amazon referral links for hardware, for example [our hardware modules](http://github.com/tessel/hardware-modules) recommendation list.
3. We receive money directly through donations.
4. We receive money through partnerships or sponsorships with companies.

## What these funds are used for

The Tessel Project has no persons on payroll and is staffed entirely by volunteers. Funds must be approved for use by the Steering Committe. These are allocated for a few broad uses:

1. The purchasing of hardware directly from manufacturing partners for use in hackathons, advertisements, conferences, or direct engagement with customers or team members.
2. Equipment for the testing and validation of hardware. For example: micro USB cables, Tessels, and Tessel modules may be purchased to diagnose a specific hardware issue occurring under circumstances we need to recreate in-house. Another example is the purchase of logic or radio analyzers, which are usually shared within the team.
3. In limited (one-off) quantities, we may purchase swag to reward volunteers.
4. The funding of additional R&D, when required. For example: if the Tessel Project moves forward with a new module, we may need to fund the purchase of a breakout board or potentially a prototype board.
5. In limited circumstances, we may fund contracting work done by individuals, depending on the urgency of the task for the community.

## Funding Potential

The Tessel Project is open to directly funding tools, R&D, and bug/feature bounties. Please [submit an RFC](https://github.com/tessel/rfcs) to suggest any of these.
